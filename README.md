This project analyzes the factors influencing students' impulse buying behavior on **TikTok Shop**. By examining various data sources, we apply statistical methods and machine learning techniques to uncover the key drivers of impulsive purchasing decisions on the platform.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding patterns in the data.
- **Statistical Testing**: Identifying significant factors influencing buying behavior.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using the **Random Forest** algorithm to predict impulse buying behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations using **Power BI** to present insights.

### Technologies Used:
- **Power BI** for visualizations and modeling
- **Python** (Random Forest) for machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for additional visualization

This analysis provides actionable insights to help businesses optimize their marketing strategies on TikTok and similar e-commerce platforms.
